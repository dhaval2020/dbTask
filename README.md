# dbTask

I used recyclerview third party library in this project to display list of product.
Recyclerview is modified version of listview
in recyclerview, view holder pattern is compulsory which was optional in listview
since view is recycled,it saves lot of memory space
recyclerview is used for horizontal list,verical list,in pinterest like layout,etc
we can use item animator and  also divider in recucle view
